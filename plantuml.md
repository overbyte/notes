## Help with Layout

The layouts can go a bit mad with Graphviz so may require a few helpful techniques to tame them.

* set direction of lines with `-u-` (up), `-d-` (down), `-l-` (left), `-r-` (right)
* hidden lines to create hidden connections between items: `-[hidden]-`
* grouping nodes by wrapping them with `together {}`
* setting some connectors to be longer by adding more dashes: `---->>`
