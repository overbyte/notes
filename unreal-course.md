# Unreal Course

These are my notes about the C++ Unreal Course on Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/

## Using vim for editor

I'm going to try to use vim for my IDE but if it goes wrong 

### Using vim-cpp

https://github.com/vim-jp/vim-cpp

## Compiling C++ on Linux

Pass the main file into `g++`

### Example

```
g++ main.cpp -o applicationname
```

**TODO**: We should probably create a `MakeFile` to simplify this process

#### Research

## Code Style

[learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/whitespace-and-basic-formatting/)
doesn't have a preference for tabs vs spaces but does prefer 1TB (One True
Brace) style for brackets.
